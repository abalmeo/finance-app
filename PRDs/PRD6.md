this is an example of the csv, i want you to categorize by the account(s) because there are some accounts that I share with Katrina and others that i don't but still want to track for myself.

Write a prd for this. I also want the code to be easy to configure becasue there might be some things that I want to change i.e. categorize multiple accounts together or aggregating them. For example.

Account 1 and Account 2 will be togehter in a separate tab while Acct3, Acc4, and Acct5 will be together in another tab

# ðŸ’³ Finance CSV Categorization App â€” PRD

## Overview

This app processes a financial CSV file (e.g., from Mint, a bank, or manual export), categorizes transactions by account, and allows flexible grouping of multiple accounts into defined categories (tabs). The result is saved in an Excel workbook with one sheet per account group.

---

## Goals

- âœ… Categorize and filter transactions based on the `Account` field
- âœ… Group multiple accounts together for combined tracking
- âœ… Output the result into an Excel file with each group in a separate sheet
- âœ… Allow for easy configuration of account groupings without editing core logic

---

## Input Format

The input is a CSV with the following columns:

- `Hidden for Privacy`
- `Hidden for Privacy`
- `Hidden for Privacy`
- `Hidden for Privacy`

---

## Configuration

A dictionary defines how accounts should be grouped:

```python
account_groups = {
    "Hidden for Privacy":
}
