Ok I think going back and forth between this. I now am just thinking about AI agents doing this. Is that even riskier?

# 🤖 AI Agents for Finance Automation: Is It Riskier?

You're thinking in the right direction — balancing power vs. risk is key when automating sensitive workflows like finances.

## ⚠️ Risk Comparison

| Method                          | Risk Level | Description |
|---------------------------------|------------|-------------|
| **Manual login + automation**   | 🔐 Low      | You log in manually. No credentials are stored or automated. Safe and controlled. |
| **Local Chrome profile reuse**  | 🟡 Medium   | Reuses existing login sessions. Slight risk if someone accesses your local user data. |
| **AI agent with full access**   | 🔴 High     | The agent automates everything — including logins and data handling. Powerful but risky. |

## 🚨 Why AI Agents Can Be Risky

1. **Credential Handling**  
   - Hardcoding or injecting credentials is dangerous.
   - If not stored securely (e.g., using a secrets manager), you risk exposure.

2. **Security Boundaries**  
   - Agents may download files, click links, or navigate incorrectly.
   - They can make irreversible actions on sensitive websites.

3. **Unintended Behavior**  
   - Agents may misinterpret UI or take the wrong action.
   - Without safeguards, they might corrupt or leak financial data.

4. **No Built-In Audit Trail**  
   - Most agents don't automatically log actions or errors.
   - Harder to debug or review what the agent did without custom logging.

## ✅ Safer Ways to Use AI Agents

If you still want to use AI agents, here’s how to reduce risk:

- **Manual Login First**  
  Let the user log in, then start automation once authenticated.

- **Handle Only Local Files**  
  AI processes exported CSVs, not live financial websites.

- **Use OAuth Tokens (for APIs)**  
  Safer than storing passwords; can be scoped and revoked.

- **Sandbox the Agent**  
  Keep it running locally with no internet access unless needed.

## 🧭 Recommendation

Use AI agents for **post-login or offline workflows** (e.g., categorizing CSVs, writing to Google Sheets), and keep **login and sensitive site navigation manual or profile-based** for now.
